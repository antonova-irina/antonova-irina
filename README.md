## Hello, World! I'm Iryna Antonova 👋

A full-stack junior developer who decided to make a career change, daring a deep dive into the stuff that for many years remained rather a hobby...

#### ⚡As long as it's something you truly want to do, it's never too late to take the first step!

💬 Passionate about building neat, functional and user-friendly web applications. </br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Mobile App Development. I love it! </br>
🔭 I’m currently working on a Wordpress e-commerce project with REST API integrations. </br>
⚡ The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know. But ✨ _I'm not going to give up_ ✨, since I really enjoy this endless journey of learning!
